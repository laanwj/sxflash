= How to get into the bootloader
==============================================================================

This utility only works if the device is executing the bootloader. If you
have a serial console attached you should see something about a CAKE / CREAM /
DISH debug shell.

Belkin F5L049:

Hold the 'reset' button (at the bottom of the device) before powering on
the device, then release it immediately. 

==============================================================================
= Usage
==============================================================================
Usage: sxflash eth0 <file.hex>

!! The entire flash (app area) is cleared before starting !! 
  if your device is still in unbricked state, make sure that you have a backup.

Input must be in Motorola Hex format. Make sure that the input file targets
the application area. This is 0xBF120000 - BFFF0000 in the Belkin F5L049.

(the bootloader does a range check, but don't rely on this. If you manage to overwrite it, 
JTAG is the only remaining unbrick option)

After flashing, the command will be sent to boot into the OS.

==============================================================================
= Building the firmware from source
==============================================================================

To build a firmware image you can use the GPL firmware and MIPS toolchain
you can find on http://www.belkin.com/support/opensource/ .

Follow the instructions in the firmware 'README.TXT' carefully.

Make sure that you extract the files as root, and build the sources as root.
As the archive contains /dev/... device nodes for the preinstall file system,
extracting as user will result in an invalid firmware. This is how I bricked
my device in the first place.

The file to use with this program will be called
"F5L049v1000_1.00.04_OSS/build/Van_Halen.hex".

= Important
==============================================================================

This program is meant to be use with one Silex device connected to the 
ethernet port. The utility automatically finds out what the MAC address of 
the target is by sending a Sx browse request. Obviously, this only works if
there is only a single Sx device connected to that ethernet port. It also 
doesn't check the origin of packets at the moment (as long as they have the 
right ethertype 0x8813 and are adressed to us). To support multiple devices 
on, the program needs a few changes.
